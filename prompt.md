look through the pydantic v2 docs online,and the temp.md file, how do I make a single class rely on one api key but, if we updated the class to have an attribute `llm_provider` and then conditionally gathered the api key from the enviro, but always kept the openai api key, how would we do that? should we do things post init if the toml or cli were to have an llm provider other than openai? remember, we have to have openai api key because graphit uses it for embeddings. @llm_client_conag_output.md has the actuaal implementation for the the graphiti llm clients including anthropic. look at the llm_factory.py file, make sure it has a clear separation of concerns and is easy to understand.
look at the temp.md file and use that as a guide to implement the changes. propose a plan, to implement the changes.
