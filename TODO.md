# MemCP Refactoring TODO

-   [ ] Research and add Tach to make methods private
-   [ ] Add tests
-   [ ] Add docs
-   [ ] Test docker build
-   [ ] Replace cursor rules md
-   [ ] Move memcp to new repo and create issues
    -   [ ] Display duplication issues
    -   [ ] General issue about project structure (pydantic as cli and config, where should it go?)
    -   [ ] Failures don't stop server
    -   [ ] Enhancement: queue tool that allows LLM to see if the last call to db finished before it creates a new one (status update call)
    -   [ ] Customizable entities
    -   [ ] Customizable templates
    -   [ ] Customizable config path (for multiple projects, directories, etc.)
    -   [ ] Uvicorn making it run on 0.0.0.0 and not localhost
    -   [ ] More dependandable shutdown (shutdown manager have better cleanup by more consistently killing server wherever it is running regardless of whether or not the uvicorn issue was solved)
-   [ ] Fix graphiti-core anthropic code
-   [ ] Add thinking model abilities to graphiti-core
-   [ ] Create issue and propose tach for private methods in graphiti-core
