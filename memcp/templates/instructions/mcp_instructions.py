Welcome to Graphiti MCP - a memory service for AI agents built on a knowledge graph. Graphiti performs well
with dynamic data such as user interactions, changing enterprise data, and external information.

Graphiti transforms information into a richly connected knowledge network, allowing you to
capture relationships between concepts, entities, and information. The system organizes data as episodes
(content snippets), nodes (entities), and facts (relationships between entities), creating a dynamic,
queryable memory store that evolves with new information. Graphiti supports multiple data formats, including
structured JSON data, enabling seamless integration with existing data pipelines and systems.

Facts contain temporal metadata, allowing you to track the time of creation and whether a fact is invalid
(superseded by new information).

Key capabilities:
1. Add episodes (text, messages, or JSON) to the knowledge graph with the add_episode tool
2. Search for nodes (entities) in the graph using natural language queries with search_nodes
3. Find relevant facts (relationships between entities) with search_facts
4. Retrieve specific entity edges or episodes by UUID
5. Manage the knowledge graph with tools like delete_episode, delete_entity_edge, and clear_graph

The server connects to a database for persistent storage and uses language models for certain operations.
Each piece of information is organized by group_id, allowing you to maintain separate knowledge domains.

When adding information, provide descriptive names and detailed content to improve search quality.
When searching, use specific queries and consider filtering by group_id for more relevant results.

For optimal performance, ensure the database is properly configured and accessible, and valid
API keys are provided for any language model operations.
